1
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,040
Dammit, more magic?!

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,460
Those damn vampires!

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,290
We have to murder them
before they invoke their ma-

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,880
Flames, oh flames...

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,330
Ice, oh ice...

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,290
I have a message from the commander!

7
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,540
The Lapelico army has already been
completely decimated!

8
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,830
The victory of the Komari unit
is clear as day!

9
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,040
See that, you inferior beast-folk?

10
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,000
Guess we're having those beast-folk's blood
made into liquor for our victory party, eh?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,880
It's too early for celebration.

12
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,330
Victory has yet to be decided.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,920
Rejoicing in a situation where the enemy
may have some sort of ace up their sleeve

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,880
is quite low-class.

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,460
Shame on you.

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,290
This current battle is the first campaign
for us, the Mulnite Empire.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,920
We absolutely will not be beaten.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,630
Am I right, Your Excellency Terakomari?

19
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,500
Yes, you are correct, Caostel.

20
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,080
Listen up, everyone!

21
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,330
I am Terakomari Gandesblood!

22
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,250
I've been a professional shut-in
for the past three years.

23
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,500
The Vexations of a Shut-in Vampire Princess

24
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,130
The Shut-in Vampire Goes Outside

25
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,130
I constantly think about
how the world is so irrational.

26
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,580
15 years ago, I was born into
the Gandesblood clan,

27
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,250
one of the most noble clans
in the Mulnite Empire.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,750
The Gandesblood family has passed down

29
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,830
the title of imperial general for
the last thousand years.

30
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,080
I tried hard to meet the expectations
of those around me...

31
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,500
But I quickly got frustrated.

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,790
I was lacking in aptitude
in every possible way.

33
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,380
First of all, I can't use magic.

34
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,710
Secondly, my athletic ability is non-existent.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,830
And third, I'm short.

36
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,210
It's clear to me the reason why I am
burdened by this trifecta of misfortune.

37
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,540
Even though I'm a vampire,
I can't drink blood.

38
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,460
It's a necessary source of nutrition
for growth, but I just can't stand it.

39
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,290
The smell, the sight;

40
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,880
I hate everything about it.

41
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,290
In a plethora of ways, my life has
only ever been full of bitter memories.

42
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,130
Power is everything in vampire society...

43
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,920
I swore to be a peace-loving,
righteous vampire,

44
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,250
and decided to shut myself in.

45
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Wha?

46
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,830
The Mulnite national emblem...

47
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,710
Why?

48
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,130
Lady Terakomari, good morning.

49
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,080
Wh-who are you?!
Why are you in my room?

50
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,330
I should have introduced myself sooner.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,040
I am Villhaze.

52
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,750
I belong to the Mulnite Imperial Army.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,540
My rank is junior lieutenant, third division.

54
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,670
I've taken up a new job as Lady Terakomari's
personal maid, starting today.

55
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,080
Still...

56
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,330
Pardon my saying so,
but this room is quite the mess.

57
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,540
What are you here for? Is it money?

58
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,790
Please don't be afraid.

59
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,880
I am an ally, Lady Terakomari.

60
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,830
Hey, Villhaze or whatever...

61
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,750
Wait right here a sec.

62
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,630
We have no time for that.

63
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,790
Come with me now to the imperial court.

64
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,210
Let me go! I have to go pee!

65
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,580
This is no time to pee.

66
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,630
Please listen to me.

67
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,500
I'm going to pee myself!
Is that what you want?!

68
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,000
Please listen to me while you pee yourself.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,540
That's pretty perverted, don't you think?!

70
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,790
There's no time for this,
so please do as I say.

71
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,130
No! You're gonna kidnap me!

72
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,880
Beauty like mine only comes around
once ever hundred million years, you know!

73
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,880
Is that something you can say about yourself?

74
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,500
Let her go, Vill.

75
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,290
Oh, Komari!

76
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,170
Are you hurt?

77
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,460
Ou...ouch. Gonna die...

78
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,500
More importantly, Dad!
What is her deal?!

79
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,330
This is Vill, and she'll be your
personal maid starting today.

80
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,830
I don't need a maid.

81
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,960
Especially one this scary...

82
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,710
Even so, this has been decided
by the Her Majesty.

83
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,790
The empress? What do you mean?

84
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,540
Let me explain that to you.

85
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,330
Lady Terakomari.

86
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,250
Do you know of the Seven Crimson Lords?

87
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,460
Where's this coming from?

88
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,210
I mean, yes, I know of them.

89
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,880
The Seven Crimson Lords...

90
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,580
They're seven super strong,
most fearless fighters among vampires

91
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,420
who lead the Mulnite Army.

92
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,630
And you have become one of them,
Lady Komari.

93
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,500
Huh?

94
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,580
The other day, when I asked you
"How about you start working soon?"

95
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,210
and you replied:

96
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,040
Well, I don't mind working
if I get the throne.

97
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,170
I was so moved!

98
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,170
I went and reported it to
the empress the other day,

99
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,960
and I said "Please, pass
the throne to Komari."

100
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,710
Are you nuts?!

101
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,750
I did my very best for you.

102
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,920
I then emphasized to a
thoroughly pissed empress

103
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,080
just how much of a prodigy you are
while still having a beauty

104
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,170
that only comes around once every
hundred million years.

105
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,790
And then, the empress said "Interesting."

106
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,420
This is NOT interesting!

107
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,920
Thus, the empress entered
a contract with you,

108
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,130
and that's how you were appointed
as a Crimson Lord.

109
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,380
Well, I have no recollection of
that contract, though.

110
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,580
She snuck in last night.

111
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,540
Who did?

112
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,330
The empress.

113
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,250
Huh?

114
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,250
While you were sleeping, Lady Terakomari,
she kissed you, thus sealing the contract.

115
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,540
Whaaaaaat?!

116
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,330
Well, hello! Welcome Komari!

117
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,460
And you are just as darling as always!

118
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,380
We are simply overjoyed to see you!

119
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,710
It's an honor, but... um, Your Majesty...

120
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,460
you're a little close for comfort,
don't you think?

121
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,750
By the way, We would like to
massage your boobs, may We?

122
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,790
Your Majesty, please lighten up with the jokes.

123
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,790
She will cry.

124
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,500
It's just a joke!

125
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,380
We are the type who takes emotions
into great consideration.

126
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,960
Until you are in the mood for it,
We will massage your boobs.

127
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,830
You kissed me, right?

128
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,830
How funny!

129
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,960
Honorifics don't suit you!

130
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,880
From here on, you should treat Us as
a friend you have known for 10 years!

131
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,040
I've never had a single friend before.

132
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,670
Now then, Terakomari Gandesblood.

133
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,830
I called on you for no other reason
than to tell you that...

134
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,460
It's time for the segment to explain the points
of note upon becoming a Crimson Lord!

135
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,670
Bam bam! Woo-hoo!

136
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,290
What's up with that picture?!

137
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,250
The Crimson Lords have one condition
under which they must operate:

138
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,920
Once every three months, they must
go to war with another nation and win.

139
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,250
Furthermore, once the 100th war is won,

140
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,170
you can gain candidacy
to become the next empress.

141
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,210
That's an impossible hurdle to clear.

142
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,880
On the other hand, if you
continue to lose in these wars...

143
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,040
Will I get the chop?

144
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,460
Yes! You'll explode and
that head will definitely fly!

145
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,790
You have got to be kidding me!

146
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,500
Please don't crush my expectations!

147
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,790
Don't worry.

148
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:39,420
You are in charge of around 500 men
from the 7th unit of the army.

149
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,830
However, it is teeming with those who will

150
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,500
certainly aim to murder their superior
upon learning they are weak.

151
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,750
Then aren't they basically my enemies?!

152
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,750
How can I not worry?!

153
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,580
Vampires are the type that desire
the chance to move up in the world.

154
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,710
Komari...

155
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,540
You're actually weak, yes?

156
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,790
Yes, super weak!

157
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,420
Dying is that thing where like...
it's really painful, right?!

158
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,080
It hurts more than bashing a pinky finger
in the corner of a dresser, doesn't it?!

159
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,500
Then you don't want to die?

160
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,380
Of course I don't!

161
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,830
Then it must be kept secret.

162
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,580
No matter what happens,

163
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,080
you must behave as the absolute strongest
while in front of your troops.

164
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,080
The maid next to you will be
your support with that.

165
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,290
Please consider me capable, Lady Komari.

166
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,750
We shall make sure to fool them all.

167
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,880
I feel nothing but anxiety...

168
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,750
You won't try to overthrow me, right, Vill?

169
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,330
Of course not.

170
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,920
I love you more than anyone else
in the universe, Lady Komari.

171
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,500
A bold-faced lie.

172
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,420
We just met today.

173
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,790
It suits you quite well, Lady Komari.

174
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,500
I-I suppose it does!

175
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Well, I may not look it,
despite how I look now,

176
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,670
beauty like mine only comes around
once ever hundred million years, you know!

177
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,710
Anything I put on looks amazing on me.

178
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,250
That's wonderful, you're so pretty.

179
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,210
In that case, how about we do a fashion show
starring you when we get back?

180
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,000
Like hell we will, that's dumb!

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Now, Lady Komari.

182
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,130
The troops you will command
are waiting for you.

183
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,670
Y-yeah...

184
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,080
This door must seriously weigh like
a million tons or something...

185
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,210
It can't possibly, your run-of-the-mill
vampire should be able to open it.

186
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,170
Well, sorry for being so abnormally weak!

187
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,540
You've got this, Lady Komari.

188
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,290
Hey! Don't just stand there!

189
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,750
Help me!

190
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,670
Ah, it's ope-

191
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:56,500
Die, Your Excellency!

192
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,670
Lady Komari, are you all right?

193
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,420
I-I-I-I-I..

194
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,330
I'm-I'm-I'm...

195
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,830
There, there. Good girl.

196
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,290
Wh-what am I gonna do?

197
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,380
They'll probably find out
that I'm incredibly weak...

198
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,080
No need to worry.

199
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,130
You've triumphed over an insolent rebel.

200
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,130
Vill, is he...

201
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,540
He is dead.

202
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,540
He's dead?!

203
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh no, how did this happen?

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,580
Maybe I should leave some flowers...

205
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,630
All a moron like him needs
is spit on his corpse.

206
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,670
More importantly, let's go.

207
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,540
Your troops are waiting.

208
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,920
R-right...

209
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,170
Am I really welcoming subjugation?

210
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,580
Can I make it out of here alive...?

211
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,460
Your Excellency, I am convinced.

212
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,330
To think that of all people, Yohan Helders,

213
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:25,420
Used to be Yohan

214
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,960
who is especially hot-blooded even among
this 7th unit, would be killed in one strike...

215
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,960
I can handle a vampire of his caliber
with a single pinky finger!

216
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,330
Whoa, she's joking, right?

217
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,170
No way...

218
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,880
This new commander's savage...

219
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,210
By the way, as a child,

220
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,710
Lady Komari slayed a hundred vampires
with a single pinky finger.

221
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,830
If Lady Komari got serious,

222
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,880
it would be possible for her to slaughter
everyone one here in five seconds.

223
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,210
Damn you! I don't need your input here!

224
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,830
Anyone would be able to
figure out that's a lie!

225
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,750
Hey! Put that thumb back down!

226
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,000
You didn't help me out here at all!

227
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,880
Ahem, more importantly, is it all right
if I greet the whole troop now?

228
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,000
Yes, ma'am! You may do as you please!

229
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,630
The 7th Unit...

230
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,750
No, Commander Komari's troop members

231
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,420
are sincerely and impatiently waiting for
Your Excellency's greeting.

232
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,130
Everyone!

233
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:35,540
I am the new Shichiguten,
Terakomari Gandesblood!

234
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,250
Now that I have become your commander,

235
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,790
understand that you will
no longer live the tranquilili...

236
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,080
Lady Komari was so nervous
she flubbed up her speech.

237
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,920
Well? Adorable, isn't she?

238
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,290
Just kick me while I'm down, why don'tcha?!
Back me up!

239
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,290
Understand that you will no longer have
the tranquil life you have been living!

240
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,670
From here on, every day will be war!

241
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,670
The flow of blood will be endless!

242
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,830
The carnage will be daily!

243
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,500
But be at ease, all you need to do
is silently follow me!

244
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,380
Never let the thought of stupid things
like overthrowing me cross your mind,

245
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:23,210
and just be faithful to the sweet and mighty
Terakomari Gandesblood!

246
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,040
I give you my word!

247
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,250
If you follow me,
for as long as war rages on,

248
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,920
I will allow you to enjoy
boundless daily pleasure!

249
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,580
Our first campaign is against
the Lapelico Kingdom's army,

250
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,420
and our first battle is with
the nobodies led by monkeys!

251
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,540
Simply winning is not enough!
We will be known all over the world!

252
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,290
They will know the truth that I,
Terakomari Gandesblood,

253
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,080
am the vampire who will become
conqueror of the world!

254
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,670
I have an urgent message!

255
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,080
Lieutenant Bellius has killed
the enemy general!

256
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,710
Our army has won!

257
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,000
I mean, if I had been on the battlefield,

258
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,210
I could've torn the enemy general
to pieces in three seconds, though.

259
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,920
Three seconds?

260
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,880
No, my mistake! One second, just one!

261
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,880
I'd stomp every last one of them
in one second!

262
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Whoa!

263
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,380
Komarin! Komarin! Komarin! Komarin!

264
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,630
Komarin! Komarin!

265
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,500
Well done, everyone!

266
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,130
However, the beasts are not our only enemies!

267
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,130
The Warblades of the Gerra Arka Republic,

268
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:34,750
and the Sapphires of the Haku-Goku
Commonwealth will learn of my strength!

269
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,580
Also, uh...

270
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,710
The Heavenly Paradise and
The Enchanted Lands.

271
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,580
Right!

272
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,330
The Heavenly Paradise and The Enchanted Lands
will be thoroughly trounced!

273
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,080
Yeah!

274
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,330
Yes, all you have to do is
stay loyal to the all mighty me!

275
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,960
Under all circumstances,
follow me faithfully and obediently!

276
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,210
Do not think of overthrowing me!

277
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,210
Never think of that!

278
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:03,080
All you have to do is
believe in and protect me!

279
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,920
Yeah!

280
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,460
Come, let us go forth and conquer,
my dear soldiers!

281
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,080
Over there lies the vivid,
blood-red color of glory!

282
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,080
Komarin! Komarin! Komarin! Komarin!

283
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,880
How did this happen?

284
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,380
Pardon me, do you have a moment?!

285
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,040
I'm Melka Tiano of
the Six Nations Newspaper!

286
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,420
Lady Terakomari Gandesblood,
is it all right if I interview you?!

287
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:40,170
S-sure, ask me anything, but can you
start by giving me some space?

288
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:40,580
Thank you so much!

289
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,420
Hey!
Thank you so much!

290
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,420
What were the circumstances that led
to you becoming a Crimson Lord?!

291
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,920
What relationship do you have
with Her Majesty?!

292
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,040
What kind of food do you like?!

293
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,540
Is it true that you killed a hundred vampires
with your pinky finger?!

294
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,670
Do you have any lovers?

295
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,670
Who was your first kiss?

296
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,170
Enough, get away!

297
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,580
The strong do not speak with words!

298
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,960
But that may cause problems for you,
so I'll tell you just a bit!

299
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,460
What I will be doing from now on
is simply boundless domination!

300
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,830
Namely, Terakomari Gandesblood...

301
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:14,000
will annihilate all of the commanders
of the five other nations in battle,

302
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,670
and spread the word of the might of
Mulnite over the entire world!

303
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,920
You got that?!

304
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,960
W-wow...

305
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,540
By the way, my favorite food
is omelette rice!

306
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,580
That is all!

307
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,040
Now THIS is a Crimson Lord.

308
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,210
The very strongest of the vampires...

309
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,580
Thank you, gods...

310
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,460
I am blessed to be born in the same
generation is Her Excellency!

311
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,500
Hey! This way, please!

312
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,130
Yes, very cute! Wonderful!

313
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,250
What is the point of this?
Yes, very cute! Wonderful!

314
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,580
Haven't died in a long time.

315
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,000
Sure is rough, huh...

316
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:13,210
In this world, a war where you
live or die doesn't exist.

317
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,500
Each one of the six nations in this world
possesses its own "Dark Core,"

318
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,250
a super high grade ritual article
that produces boundless magic.

319
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,630
As far as the influence of
the Dark Core's magic is concerned,

320
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,170
however deep the wound,

321
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,880
however tragic the death it was,

322
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,540
after a certain amount of time passes,
one will completely recover.

323
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,290
As such, the place I'm standing now
is the "Dark Core Zone."

324
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,880
It's the special area where the Dark Cores
of the six nations overlap perfectly,

325
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,040
and the wars among us all occur
exclusively in this area.

326
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,580
What do you think, Lady Komari?

327
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,420
This is the so called "entertainment war."

328
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,630
I cannot stand how absurd this is.

329
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,170
Good morning, Lady Komari.

330
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,540
Y-you! Why are you here?!

331
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,250
Ah.

332
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,880
Why are you naked?!

333
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,380
Ah!

334
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,170
Get some clothes on now!

335
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,380
Lady Komari, please have a look
at today's newspaper.

336
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,710
See, your picture from yesterday is on it.

337
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,500
What are you talking about?!

338
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,130
Now is not the time for newspaper... hm?

339
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,920
"New Shichiguten Bursts Onto the Scene,

340
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,420
Will Make the Entire World
Into Omelette Rice"

341
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,580
"I love omelette rice.

342
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,790
I will murder the commanders
of the other five nations,

343
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,290
"haphazardly dump ketchup on them,

344
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,290
and make them look like omelette rice
with the insides scooped out."

345
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,170
This is pure and simple fake news!

346
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,920
It's already totally agitating
the other nations, isn't it?!

347
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,040
Correct. According to the article,
a chimpanzee killed yesterday said:

348
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,080
"She won't get away with this!

349
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,210
Sooner or later we will
thoroughly disgrace you!"

350
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,710
And, they were shamelessly making
death threats in the national paper.

351
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,250
Nooooooo!!!!

352
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,040
Please relax.

353
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,580
I will protect your chastity, Lady Komari.

354
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,750
You're the one I'm most worried about!

355
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,380
Lady Komari, about today's plans...

356
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,920
Aaaaah, I can't hear you!

357
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,670
Today is my day off!

358
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,920
If you're going to stay under the covers forever,

359
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
I have some ideas of my own.

360
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,210
Hmph, if you come even one step closer to me,

361
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,880
I'm gonna cry so hard I hiccup!

362
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,170
"The Strawberry Milk Formula."

363
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,920
"I thought I wanted a love
like strawberry milk.

364
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:15,500
Sweet and mild, without the thrill
that teasingly torments the tongue,

365
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,460
eternally warm, gentle;
a love like sunshine.

366
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,920
Stop iiiiiiit!

367
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,790
I found it when I was rummaging
through your trash can.

368
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,290
Nevertheless, it is still a surprise
to see a love story.

369
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,580
Anyways, if you continue to
skip out on your duties,

370
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,040
I will distribute this story throughout
the imperial court, are you okay with that?

371
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,040
With the writer's name attached, of course.

372
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
What?

373
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,920
Lady Komari, are you listening?

374
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,630
I'll do whatever you say...

375
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:55,250
I'm begging you, please don't tell anyone.

376
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,630
Do not worry, I will not be doing that.

377
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,290
Th-thanks, Vi-

378
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,580
Ahhh!

379
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,130
Smells so, so good!

380
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,630
If I'm sniffing something, I should go
for her directly and not her pillow!

381
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,330
Ah, I want to ascend to Heaven enraptured by
this sweet scent of strawberry milk!

382
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,330
She is the creep of the century!

383
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,920
I'm exhausted.

384
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,580
How long has it been since I've
talked to someone this much?

385
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,080
Try to fight back at least a little, c'mon!

386
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,670
Stop...

387
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,290
I don't like it, it hurts...

388
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,170
I will never allow it!

389
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,380
A Sudden Insurrection

390
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,130
"A Sudden Insurrection."
