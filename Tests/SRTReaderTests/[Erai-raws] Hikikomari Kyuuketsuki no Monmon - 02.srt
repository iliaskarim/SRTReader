1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,080
Well?

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,080
What am I doing today?

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,170
Lady Komari, today you'll have a meeting
with those executive-level oaficers.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,250
Hey, did you just say "oaficers"?

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,920
Don't you mean "officers"?

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,750
Now, let's get those clothes changed.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,000
Whoa, hey! Wait!

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,380
I don't wanna! Stop! Whoa!

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,630
I don't need to take off the panties!

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,460
And so, getting stright to the point,
I have a question for you all.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,790
How would you like to proceed from here on?

12
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,920
Fight and a fightin', fight fight fightin'...

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,500
Perpetual war.

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,710
Lieutenant Bellius Hund Cerbero

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,710
Demoted on murder charges

16
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,960
I want to witness Your Excellency's success.

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,170
Lieutenant Caostel Conto

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,170
Demoted on suspicion of kidnapping a young girl

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,130
A rap battle with Your Excellency yo!

20
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,170
Ooh yeah!

21
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,380
Captain Mellanconcey

22
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,380
Demoted on failed attempt to blow up the palace

23
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,880
O-of course...

24
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,880
But for now, you would like
to have war, right?

25
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,750
That is correct.

26
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,580
Now then, we shall continue on to the rewards
from Her Excellency Terakomari.

27
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,420
What?

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,880
Her Excellency greatly appreciates

29
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,000
your success in the previous battle
against Lapelico Kingdom,

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,080
and she has decided to
repay you for your actions.

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,210
Your Excellency is so perfectly photogenic.

32
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,420
But, if I had any say in it, then...

33
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,960
I would increase your variety of clothing!

34
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,670
All right, that's the death penalty!
Death penalty for you!

35
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,830
I do think it suits you extremely well, though.

36
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,670
Just get to dying!

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,130
I will... withhold my request for now.

38
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,580
Okay.

39
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,790
Yeah, rap battle!

40
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,210
Yeah!

41
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,540
It's Bloodbath Rapper Mellaconcey,

42
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,670
all my peeps suffer when I sing a high key!

43
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,460
You're the only one vibin'
with my flow so sick,

44
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,790
it's me and you and dead bodies,
all up on our 'fits!

45
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,790
Yeah!

46
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,290
Yo! Yo!

47
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,250
I'm General Komarin,
super strong, can't get no higher!

48
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,130
A wise lil' ruler in this dark empire!

49
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,130
So who's your number one,
who are you fond of?

50
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,000
Just ask anybody, they all get my love!

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,330
Yeah!

52
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:30,750
The Vexations of a Shut-in Vampire Princess

53
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,830
A Sudden Insurrection

54
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,830
The person known as Terakomari Gandesblood

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,580
is a tremendous mystery.

56
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,790
And what is that?

57
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,040
A classified document from the imperial court.

58
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,130
The imperial academy raid which caused

59
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,130
an uproar throught the empire
three years ago...

60
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,920
Those details are noted here...

61
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,500
Hey, why do you have something like that?

62
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,420
The culprit in that case is Her Excellency.

63
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,920
What?

64
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,630
According to this part...

65
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,290
There were 30 deaths on the academey's side,

66
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,790
and 70 deaths from the imperial army's
third unit who were sent to take control...

67
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,710
they were all killed with one pinky finger.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,210
By the way, as a child Lady Komari slayed
a hundred vampires with a single pinky finger.

69
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,830
Wait... the culprit in that incident
should be someone else.

70
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,380
The guilty party was switched.

71
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,130
To tell the truth, this part that says
"Terakomari Gandesblood"

72
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,630
is being reported as "Millicent Bluenight"
who has nothing to do with this.

73
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,710
I don't understand.

74
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't either, but...

75
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,750
Three years ago, Her Excellency Terakomari

76
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,080
caused a massacre the likes of which
we have never seen before,

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,750
is what this means.

78
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,830
Hey, you over there, this place is off-limits
unless you work for the palace.

79
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,500
If you don't want to be killed...

80
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,750
The palace guards are surprisingly steadfast.

81
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,080
I thought I could just go into
the empress' palace and kill her, but...

82
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,960
Thanks to the wall-defense magic,
I couldn't get in.

83
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,380
You... are you trying to take out the empress?

84
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,170
I'll kill her at some point.

85
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,290
But now is not that time.

86
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,380
Oh? Well then, why did you come here?

87
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,250
It's not anything major,
just here to check on things a bit.

88
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,750
I read in the paper that Terakomari Gandesblood
has become a Crimson Lord...

89
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,210
Is that true?

90
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,170
How optimistic to think that magic would work!

91
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,670
Is that all you've got?

92
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,170
Above you!

93
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,330
What are you even looking at?!

94
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,670
None of you can hinder me.

95
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,210
Just learning that made all this worth it.

96
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,670
Give my best to Terakomari, 'kay?

97
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,750
See ya!

98
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,210
She's going after Her Excellency.
What do we do?

99
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,920
There's nothing we can do.

100
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,920
If only I could get a reward coupon for
foot-licking from Her Excellency!

101
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,580
We will move on our own initiative
and handle her!

102
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,420
That sounds good.

103
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,130
You want a coupon for
a foot-licking reward too?!

104
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,960
No! I agree with taking the initiative!

105
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,000
Good morning, Lady Komari.

106
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,210
Oh, it's you Vill. Morning.

107
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,830
But why are you dressed like that?!
It's weird!

108
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,040
You're really good at wearing
embarassing things, huh?!

109
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,380
Do you have any shame at all?!

110
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,960
I do not.

111
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,250
Don't admit to it!
How am I supposed to react to that?!

112
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,420
About today's affairs...

113
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't care, tell my subordinates
I'm pretending to be sick.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,630
I feel it would be awkward to tell them
you were feigning illness.

115
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,330
More importantly, are you sure you want that?

116
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,250
You have important plans
to choose your beast today.

117
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,790
Huh?! By beast, you mean THAT beast?!

118
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,250
Now then, Lady Gandesblood.

119
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,670
These are the stables for the beasts.

120
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,380
Wow...

121
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,880
There they are, the beasts!
And there are so many!

122
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,460
To tell the truth, I've kind of longed
for a magical beast!

123
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,170
Come here.

124
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,330
Ah! You can't have that one, Lady Gandesblood!

125
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,250
That one is...

126
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,540
Aww, there you go!

127
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,790
Excuse me, what is that dragon?

128
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,210
That is a mizuchi native to
The Enchanted Lands,

129
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,960
and it is one of the highest classes
among all of the beasts.

130
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,500
That tickles!
and it is one of the highest classes
among all of the beasts.

131
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,080
and it is one of the highest classes
among all of the beasts.

132
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,210
But, well, it has a intense preference
for young girls,

133
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,380
and it can't open it's heart to
anyone but a young girl.

134
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,500
I see, that is certainly an explanation
I can understand.

135
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,830
Okay, I've decided!

136
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,960
This one will be my partner!

137
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,080
Now, let's go, Bucephalus!

138
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Let us ride with the wind!

139
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,790
Yo! It's a mock battle but get
blown to smithereens! YEAH!

140
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,080
Tch! Terakomari Gandesblood!

141
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,670
I will get my revenge...
I'll make sure of it!

142
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,250
Outta the way, outta the way, outta the waaay!

143
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,170
Huh?

144
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,330
Stop!

145
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,250
Huh? I'm floating?

146
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,000
Eh?

147
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,330
Oh dear, Lady Komari...

148
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,790
I tell you daily to stop with
the dramatic dismounts, and yet...

149
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,710
Vill...

150
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,790
I'm no' tanking you.

151
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,290
You seem to be tongue-tied.

152
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,790
Sh...shuddup.

153
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,790
Hurry and put me down.

154
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,960
Don't say that. Just a little longer...

155
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,790
Hey...

156
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,080
Controlling a magical beast at that speed
is just as I'd expect from her.

157
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
I thought she'd die after falling off but...
Controlling a magical beast at that speed
is just as I'd expect from her.

158
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,290
she's got some serious guts.

159
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,330
J-jus' pu' me down.

160
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,500
Right away.

161
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,630
My goodness!

162
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,330
Is that you, Your Excellency?

163
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,290
A pleasure to see you.

164
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,080
Caostel, how you doin'?

165
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,540
I am doing wonderfully, thank you.

166
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,580
Every member of the Komari unit
is giving their all in training.

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,920
Oh? I'm please ta hear dat.

168
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,580
Yes, please take part in the exercises as well,
Your Excellency, by all means!

169
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,630
What're you sayin'? If I take par'
ev'yone will die o' my sickness.

170
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,630
Certainly, that simpleton died
before challenging you to a battle.

171
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,580
Huh?

172
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,670
That piece of refuse was run over
and killed by your mount.

173
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,330
Long live Her Excellency!

174
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,670
Long live murderers!

175
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,380
Purge all traitors!

176
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,540
I'm not dead yet you boneheads!

177
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,580
Die, little girl!

178
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,170
Oh... I'm gonna d-

179
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,000
She dodged?!

180
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,040
Eh?!

181
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,380
Whaaaat?!

182
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,170
Wow, what poise!

183
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,290
Her Excellency is magnificent.
It's as if she's a matador!

184
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,170
I'm dizzy...

185
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,460
Damn it!

186
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,540
Move outta the way!

187
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,330
My eyes! My eyes!

188
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,460
S-sorry...

189
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,460
Lady Komari!

190
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,670
Let's hit him hard right here.

191
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,210
This is what happens when you defy me!

192
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,920
Next time, I'll gouge out your eyeballs
and those other balls too,

193
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,250
so make sure you're ready for that!

194
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,080
Y-you little...

195
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,460
You really got me good...

196
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,080
You'll pay for this!

197
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,290
Terakomari Gandesblood!

198
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,540
I challenge you to a duel!

199
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,210
A duel?

200
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:44,460
Komarin! Komarin! Komarin!

201
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,750
Your Excellency!
Beat the hell out of that loser!

202
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,170
Koma-tan is so great!

203
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,000
Lady Komari, can you hear me?

204
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,880
How is it going?

205
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,630
Obviously extremely crappily!

206
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,210
You can do it, this is where
you must stand firm.

207
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,210
Vill, can I...

208
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,500
Can I survive this and go home?

209
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,920
Have you forgotten?

210
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,830
Just because you're killed
does not mean you'll die.

211
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:15,290
I know that! But it hurts!
And it's hot! And I'll suffer!

212
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,500
Please relax.

213
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,710
As long as I am here, it is completely
unlikely that you will die in a duel.

214
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,210
Leave it all to me.

215
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,670
I will bring the glory of victory to you.

216
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,250
Really?

217
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,630
T-Terakomari...

218
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:51,830
T-today I will make sure you b-burn!

219
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,460
I filled his meal with poison.

220
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,080
You did this?!

221
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,460
What's wrong, Your Excellency?

222
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,920
Gonna burn, burn, burn you all up...

223
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,670
G-gonna send you to the hospital.

224
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,960
You're the one who should go to the hospital!

225
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,290
The hell you say?!

226
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,290
G-g-gonna murder...

227
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,080
What do I do about this?!

228
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,130
This is like a horror movie
that's unsuitable for kids!

229
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,130
Hey Vill!

230
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,790
Okay, Lady Komari. Use magic.

231
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,790
What?!

232
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,630
If I could do something like that
I wouldn't be struggling right now!

233
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,250
No, just act like you're using it.

234
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,040
On my signal, snap your fingers like you're
making a big show of it for everyone.

235
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,920
Huh?!

236
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,960
Here we go.

237
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,210
3, 2, 1...

238
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,250
Okay, now!

239
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,830
What was that magic?

240
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,250
She opened a hole under
her opponent's feet from that far?!

241
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,830
That's the advanced magic skill
"Kingdom Crumbler."

242
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,790
But I couldn't feel the slightest
flow of magical power...

243
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,080
In short, this means Her Excellency can
also use power-concealing magic skills.

244
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,250
Ah yes, the advanced magic skill
"Lacquered Wings," huh?

245
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,250
Lacquered Wings

246
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,080
Wow! Your Excellency is so mighty!

247
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,290
What was that?
Wow! Your Excellency is so mighty!

248
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,040
I dug a pit last night.
Amazing, Your Excellency!

249
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,670
How is that possible?!

250
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:23,330
By the way, this arena is set up
with pits in 52 places.

251
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,540
Absolutely do not move, Lady Komari.

252
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,000
You call that magic?

253
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,130
I'm not playing around, you damn fraud!

254
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,830
Hey Vill, where are the pits?

255
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,040
Unfortunately, there are no pits
on the straight line

256
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,330
connecting you and Lieutenant Helders.

257
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,630
Why not? You dug a ton of them, right?!

258
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,710
I can only attribute this to bad luck.

259
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,040
Burn!

260
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,380
Hey, time out, time out!

261
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,210
Vill, can't we do something
with the snap again?!

262
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,960
No, it's too late for that.

263
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,540
Whaddaya mean too late?!

264
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,330
Like my life is over?! You've gotta be-

265
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,630
Landmines.

266
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,920
Eh?

267
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,170
L-landmines?

268
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,080
Last night, I buried about 69 of them.

269
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,500
You didn't think this plan through very well...

270
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,790
Now Lieutenant Helders has
safely met his maker.

271
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,210
You have won, Lady Komari.

272
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,920
Uh, yeah, I guess...

273
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,920
Now you've done it...

274
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,130
I'm gonna catch you,

275
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,040
burn your clothes off,

276
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,000
and make you do the fire dance naked...

277
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,330
Huh? He's dead?

278
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,000
Lady Komari, declare your victory.

279
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,670
R-right...

280
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,250
Sorry.

281
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
The rebel is dealt with!

282
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,460
Yeah!

283
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,000
Oh, oh yeah! Oh!

284
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,630
Komarin! Komarin! Komarin!

285
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,000
Say Vill, I feel like I'm deceiving everyone.

286
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,750
It isn't just a feeling, you actually
are deceiving everyone.

287
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,420
I thought I was gonna die...

288
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,460
Maybe I should thank her too.

289
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,880
I want you to express that with your body
and not your words if at all possible,

290
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,540
so may I proceed to embrace you?

291
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,880
S-stop it, you're such a perverted maid!
Now, Lady Komari, you must
prepare to bathe with me.

292
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,960
Now, Lady Komari, you must
prepare to bathe with me.

293
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,330
Wait! Don't massage me there!

294
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,330
And you're hurt, aren't you?!

295
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,080
I only have blisters.

296
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Tomorrow they will be magically healed.

297
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,670
Tell me about your injury.

298
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,080
I can't.

299
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,330
Then this is an order, tell me about it.

300
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,040
There were pits there to kill
Yohann Helders, right?

301
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Yeah.

302
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,790
I dug them all with a shovel.

303
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,080
You did that manually?!

304
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,830
Deadly poison is the only magic I can use.

305
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,040
I-I see...

306
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,170
I apologize for showing you
something so unsightly.

307
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,960
It's not unsightly at all!

308
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,290
You worked really hard for my sake, Vill.

309
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:43,960
If you weren't there, I'd be dead right now.

310
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,170
I'm, well... grateful to you for that.

311
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,380
So... don't try to hide the injuries
you suffered for my sake.

312
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,540
I mean, I should share that
sort of injury with you.

313
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,920
So...

314
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,380
In any case, thank you.

315
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,670
That's what I mean, do you get it?

316
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,130
I do.

317
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,080
Huh? You do?

318
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,920
I understand that Lady Komari loves me.

319
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,920
Well, whatever.

320
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,380
But let me ask you...

321
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,380
Why do you cling to me so much?

322
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,790
It's a little creepy.

323
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,380
Because you have a beauty that only
comes around once every million years.

324
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,880
Well I know that.
But that's not what I mean.

325
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,170
I'm curious if there's some other,
more special reason.

326
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,580
I've commited a crime.

327
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,920
I know that too.

328
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,920
You sexually harass me like crazy.

329
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,670
Damn it!

330
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,500
Damn you, Terakomari Gandesblood!

331
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,420
You loathe her that much?

332
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,790
That little girl?

333
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,630
You're Lieutenant Helders of
the imperial army, right?

334
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,130
Who are you?

335
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,710
I'm Millicent...

336
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,630
of the sublime Inverse Moon.

337
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,710
Say.

338
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,920
Want to do business with me?

339
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,500
An invitation to that
perverted Empress's party?

340
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,790
Yes. She said it's to congratulate you
for your success and the like.

341
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,250
Huh. Will I get paid overtime,
or have a make-up holiday or...

342
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:06,000
Your Excellency, what should we do?

343
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,130
You also...

344
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,380
Er, I mean, do you dislike this sort of thing?

345
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,380
To be frank, yes.

346
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,210
I have come to live a life that has
no relation to the upper class.

347
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,380
No need to be so down on yourself.

348
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,670
There's no doubt that your military
achievements as a member of

349
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,830
the imperial army are the results
of your hard work.

350
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,040
That's something to be proud of, Bellius.

351
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,830
Y-Your Excellency...

352
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,670
Welcome, Sweet Komari!

353
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,170
Are you enjoying yourself?

354
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,330
Oh, stop. Today's festivities are informal.

355
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,920
Komari, We wouldn't mind you
calling Us "Ren-chan," not at all!

356
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,790
By the bye, Komari, how is your job
as a Crimson Lord going?

357
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,420
Like I can tell you that.

358
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,460
No need to ask, eh?

359
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,500
In the short time since you've
taken up your post,

360
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,670
you've defeated four other nations
excluding The Enchanted Lands,

361
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,000
I've never seen a Crimson Lord quite like you.

362
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,080
I was just lucky, no other explanation for it.

363
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,630
This is a party to celebrate your achievements.

364
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,170
Oh, here, how do you like
the 100% blood juice?

365
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,130
Ah, you don't like blood.

366
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:24,080
Actually, We are feeling relieved.

367
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,790
Three years ago you were
shut away in your room,

368
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,790
and it must have been difficult
to re-enter society like that,

369
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,580
but looks like your father's gamble
was a success.

370
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,790
Gamble?

371
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:41,880
Yes, he bet that you would leave your room
if you were forced to be a Crimson Lord.

372
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,000
Huh?!

373
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,080
Komari, you aren't alone anymore.

374
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,750
You have subordinates you can rely on,
and Komarists all through the empire...

375
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,830
Just like Us, there are plenty of people
that love you dearly,

376
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,880
so no matter what happens, don't fall into
despair like you did three years ago.

377
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,750
Well then, enjoy the party!

378
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,710
Terakomari.

379
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,250
Mind having a chat with me too?

380
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:11,000
The Darkness of the Shut-in Vampire Princess

381
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,500
"The Darkness of the Shut-in Vampire Princess."
